            | Neutral Dollar is an entirely new blockchain-native financial 
            | instrument. The on-chain token processes revolve around the profit-seeking 
            | behavior of rational arbitrageurs and mimics properties of a traditional 
            | ETF in a fully transparent way.

            | Creation activity drives the expansion of the Neutral token supply and the 
            | redemption mechanics cause the supply to contract. This results in 
            | globally-shared liquidity, reduced volatility, and frictionless token 
            | exchange.
