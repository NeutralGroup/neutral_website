# Own the first ever metastablecoin

We are thrilled to announce that the [Neutral Dollar](https://blog.neutralproject.com/posts/2019/01/24/intro-to-neutral-dollar.html) is now live. What has been the culmination of dedicated work and effort has led to the Neutral team creating the radical, redefining stablecoin for the cryptomarkets.

For the uninitiated, we encourage all of you to check out the rest of [Medium ](https://medium.com/@neutralproject)posts, also syndicated on our [blog](https://blog.neutralproject.com/), about some key highlights for the Neutral Dollar (NUSD):

-   We demonstrate how Neutral Dollar [is superior](https://blog.neutralproject.com/posts/2019/03/05/visualizing-metastability.html) in terms of price and risk compared to standalone stablecoins

-   We find that several stablecoins will likely compete to exist in a saturated landscape, and [make a case](https://blog.neutralproject.com/posts/2019/02/14/the-need-for-many-stablecoins-and-a-metastable-basket.html) for a basket solution to address this potential growth

-   Understanding that baskets concepts are hard to construct successfully, we point out the advantages of our product through an [interesting case study](https://blog.neutralproject.com/posts/2019/01/29/a-case-study-on-husd.html)

# Acquiring and Using NUSD

Neutral Dollar can be acquired natively by contributing one of the four component stablecoins (USDC, PAX, DAI, TUSD) through our [Neutral platform](https://neutralproject.com/download.html). For instructions on how to navigate our user interface, please refer to one of our [infographic](https://blog.neutralproject.com/posts/2019/05/14/navigating-neutral-dollar.html). Once a user acquires Neutral Dollar, he or she can send the token to other addresses or accounts. We will be rolling out several different use cases for Neutral Dollar such as storage, trading, and lending with several of our partners over the coming launch campaign.

**Important Read!** -- For a duration starting on May 15th 2019, we will initiate a time called the ‘initial contribution period’. Users at this time can collateralize any supported stablecoin for Neutral Dollar at fair value. This period is dedicated to bootstrapping our stablecoin, so during this time all redemptions are disabled. Once it is May 20th, users can continuously redeem NUSD for any component stablecoin through our interface as normally intended.

In addition users can acquire Neutral Dollar on supported exchanges just like any other cryptoasset, details which we will reveal as they are officially announced (updates will be announced as they come).

The intent of Neutral Dollar is to serve as the highest standard for stablecoins - particularly a robust store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. We also will be working with Nexo Earn in a [pilot program](https://signup.nexo.io/nexo-nusd/) where users can earn 6.5% interest on their NUSD deposits to demonstrate the opportunities with stablecoin lending.

If any enthusiasts would like to more closely engage with the Neutral team to cooperate on any fronts, please reach out to <hello@neutralproject.com>
