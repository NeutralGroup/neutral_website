### Neutral Dollar (NUSD) Introduction:

The Neutral Dollar (NUSD) is a metastable basket initially comprising of USDC, PAX, TUSD, and DAI. The NUSD basket itself is fully collateralized and inter-exchangeable with constituent stablecoins, with the ability to add new underlying stablecoins in the future. The construction is designed to be liquidity- and exchange- neutral, enabling the Neutral Dollar to have merits and applications that no individual stablecoin project alone can exhibit. The Neutral team believes the NUSD is a compelling use case for a more stable instrument for trading, hedging and investing — and also a way to facilitate broader stablecoin usage for users to serve every stablecoin need.

In addition to KuCoin, the Neutral Dollar is accessible through a web client supported by MetaMask and ImToken. Further integration will be rolled out to several wallets such as Bixin, Infinito, etc. Nexo Earn will also support Neutral Dollar in a pilot program where users can earn 6.5% interest on their deposits.

### Key Features

* Superior ‘metastability’ from an empirical and theoretical standpoint for all stablecoin use cases

* Innovative economic mechanism to aggregate liquidity for the underlying assets

* Access to change between diversified and individual stablecoin exposures for any specific application

* Autonomous, decentralized rebalancing of collateral through user participation

* Real-time transparency and verifiable on-chain settlement with better scalability
